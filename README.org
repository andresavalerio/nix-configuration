* Nix Darwin Configuration

The config files for my Nix-darwin on MacOS, built with :heart: and Nix by Andresa Val√©rio

** Why Nix?
Many of my clients use MacOS environment. You can certanly say that the most used package manager is [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]], and I use it for simpler jobs.

However, I see four main reasons to use Nix instead:

1. More control over versions;
2. Simpler way to change machine without losing environment;
3. It is compatible with my current personal environment, which is NixOS;
4. It's fun.

I pretend to make a more detailed article about this in future.
